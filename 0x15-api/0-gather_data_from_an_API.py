Let's address the PEP 8 style guide issues identified by your linter:

1. Ensure there are two blank lines before function definitions.
2. Split any line that is longer than 79 characters.
3. Ensure there are two blank lines after function definitions.
4. Remove the blank line at the end of the file.

Here is the revised script:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
"""
Returns to-do list information for a given employee ID.

This script takes an employee ID as a command-line argument and fetches
the corresponding user information and to-do list from the JSONPlaceholder API.
It then prints the tasks completed by the employee.
"""

import requests
import sys


def main():
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Usage: {} <employee_id>".format(sys.argv[0]))
        return

    employee_id = sys.argv[1]

    # Base URL for the JSONPlaceholder API
    url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/"

    try:
        # Get the employee information using the provided employee ID
        user_response = requests.get(url + "users/{}".format(employee_id))
        user_response.raise_for_status()
        user = user_response.json()

        # Get the to-do list for the employee using the provided employee ID
        todos_response = requests.get(url + "todos", params={"userId": employee_id})

        todos = todos_response.json()
